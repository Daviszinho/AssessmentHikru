## Project Structure

### Backend Components

1. **Lib.Repository**
   - Core domain models and interfaces
   - Contains entity classes: `Position`, `Recruiter`, `Department`
   - Defines the `IPositionRepository` interface for data access.
   - Contains the PositionRepository.cs file for data access.
   - Contains the Program.cs file for database connection and local initialization.

2. **SQLiteConnectivity**
   - Implements data access layer using SQLite
   - Provides database context and repository implementations
   - Handles database migrations and schema management
   - Contains the InitializeDatabase.sql file for database initialization.
   - Contains the PositionRepository.cs file for data access.
   - Contains the Program.cs file for database connection and local initialization.

3. **API.Test**
   - Unit and integration tests for the application
   - Uses xUnit testing framework
   - Includes test cases for repository and service layers
   - Dotnet clean, dotnet build and dotnet test commands.

4. **RestWebServices**
   - RESTful API endpoints for the application
   - Implements controllers for positions, recruiters, and departments
   - Handles request/response serialization and validation
   - It can be run locally using dotnet run --project RestWebServices, from the solution root directory.

5. **OracleConnectivity**
   - Optional Oracle database connectivity layer
   - Provides alternative data access implementation for Oracle databases
   - Can be used for enterprise deployments requiring Oracle.
   - INESTABLE, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION.
   - It was ready for testing locally and Oracle autonomous database.
   -Multiple issues for deployment, then using SQL Lite now.

### Frontend (WebApp)
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Modern, responsive UI with Material-UI components
- Implements CRUD operations for positions
- Real-time data updates
- Form validation and error handling
- This project is integrated with Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Actions for continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- Run locally using: dotnet clean, dotnet build, dotnet run 

## Features
- **Position Management**
  - Create, read, update, and delete job positions
  - Track position status (draft, open, closed, archived)
  - Associate positions with recruiters and departments

- **User Interface**
  - Interactive data tables with sorting and filtering
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile

- **API**
  - RESTful endpoints for all operations
  - JSON-based request/response format
  - Proper HTTP status codes and error handling

- **Testing**
  - Unit tests for business logic
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - Test coverage reporting

## Prerequisites
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (for local development)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (for deployment)

## Getting Started

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AssessmentHikru.git
   cd AssessmentHikru

2. Set up the database:
   - SQLite database will be created automatically on first run
   - For Oracle, update connection strings in appsettings.json

3. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   cd RestWebServices
   dotnet run
   ```
   Access the application at `http://localhost:5246`

4. Run the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../WebApp
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`

## Testing
Run unit tests:
```bash
cd API.Test
dotnet test
```

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment to Azure Web Apps. Update the deployment settings in the GitHdub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`: Set to `Development`, `Staging`, or `Production`
- `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`: Database connection string
- `ApiSettings:BaseUrl`: Base URL for API requests from the frontend

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a new Pull Request
   cd AssessmentHikru
   ```

2. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Build the solution:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project WebApp
   ```
   The application will be available at `https://localhost:53614`

### Running Tests
```bash
cd API.Test
dotnet test
```

## Deployment

### Prerequisites for Deployment
- Azure subscription
- Azure Web App resource created
- Azure Service Principal with Contributor access

### GitHub Secrets Configuration
Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings > Secrets > Actions):
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Azure AD application client ID
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Azure AD tenant ID
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Azure subscription ID
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Azure AD application client secret

### Deployment Process
The application is automatically deployed to Azure Web App when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The deployment workflow includes:
1. Building the application
2. Running tests
3. Publishing the application
4. Deploying to Azure Web App
